# Project Title: Digital Calculator Application

The Digital Calculator project, powered by Python, influenced by the "Python: Fundamentals for Data Analysis" course provided by the Data Science Academy, empowers users to execute five fundamental mathematical operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and Exponentiation.

Built upon Object-Oriented Programming principles, this calculator enables users to input operations seamlessly. The program guides users through the selection of desired operations from the available options. Once an operation is chosen, the calculator efficiently computes the result, enhancing the overall mathematical experience for users.
