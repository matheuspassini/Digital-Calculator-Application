# Projeto Calculadora em Python

### Project allows 5 mathematical operations and came to the fore with the course “Python: Fundamentals for Data Analysis”, from the Data Science Academy, which was proposed the challenge. Those operations are: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division and Exponentiation.


Through Object Oriented Programming, the calculator allows a loop until the user enters an available number of the desired operation. If you select the operation present on the calculator, the program will return the result.
